# AIHack
AI Hackathon MVP

A Zoom bot which provides real time feedback and suggestions based an on-going sales call, which helps customer reps and sales dev reps to do a better qualification instead of settling to a standard script and help understand customer needs better.

## To run the code

Change the api keys for OpenAI and Pinecone

run the following
`$streamlit run hackathon-audiostream.py`

It will start listening to your conversations and providing context which a seller might miss.


## TODOs:
1. Integrate with CRM
2. Create integrations with Zoom, Gmeet, Teams etc
3. Create a checklist of next steps for the rep
